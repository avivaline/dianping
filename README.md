Summary:

I got some troubles about the webpages,  a 'tag' name 'create business retailer' doesn't work,  and the list of the business can't display completely, so what I did is:

1. I delete some class which automatically generate by mybatis-generator
2. I run the mybatis-generator again, hopefully it generate the class as it used to be
3. After I import the class, run the project it goes a exception:  a dependency problem.

actually I don't know why, I google for a long time, I can't work this out by myself

PLAN: refer to the source code which had been given to me, Time is really limited, I will go back to you when I finish the whole project.
